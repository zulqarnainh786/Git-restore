    <h2>git revert cmnd</h2>
    <p>The git revert command is used to undo changes made by a specific commit in a Git repository. Unlike git reset, which can alter the commit history, git revert creates a new commit that reverses the changes introduced by the specified commit. This makes it a safer option for undoing changes, especially in shared repositories.</p>
